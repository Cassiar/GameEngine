# GameEngine
Cassiar's and Noah's project for IGME 550. Based on our code from IGME 540 GGP.
With some code from Chris Cascioli. 

# .ncscn
The Noah Cassiar SCeNe (.ncsn) file type is what allows us to store the contents of a created scene to a data file. This allows us to better test and play scenes that we set up. This section describes the written formatting of data written to in a binary file. (TODO: write out file type)
